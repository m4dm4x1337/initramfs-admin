Description: Initramfs based administration tool for encrypted root filesystems
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed and enabled, the initramfs will display a grafical user 
 interface which can be controlled with keyboard inputs.
 .
 Features include a network manager for LAN and WiFi, a crypto manager to manage
 LUKS keys, and to re-encrypt and resize a crypto partition. It is also possible
 to chroot to the root file system and to make changes to the system. This is
 particularly useful with a portable overlayfs protected root file system that
 normally does not allow changes. Many other features are available.
